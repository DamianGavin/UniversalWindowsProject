Classic memory game with features of sound and colour. Randomly generated patterns and persistence for scores. Its purpose is to
present a memory challenge by rewarding the user with more points depending on how long a pattern they can repeat, allowing them 
to improve their scores in a completely random generated environment. If they get an error repeating the pattern the game ends.


It has been created accomplishing the following requiremens:
```
Create a Universal Windows Project (UWP) that will each demonstrate the use of Isolated 
Storage and at least one other sensor or service available on the devices. These include: 

* Accelerometer or Gyroscope 
* GPS (Location Based Services)
* Sound
* Network Services (connecting to server for data updates etc)
* Camera
* Multi Touch Gesture Management

The UWP application should be well designed with a clear purpose and an answer to the 
question  “why will the user open this app for a second time?”
```
